# Shopping Cart

Using a mobile-first design approach, I created a fake shopping cart to develop my React skills. I used [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for this project, with 3 routes. I also used LocalStorage to persist data and used Cypress to test my application with End to End testing.

## Features
