# Shopping Cart

Using a mobile-first design approach, I created a shopping cart where the user can add items to a basket, fine tune the quantity of the items, remove items from the basket and once done, order the item/s. I used React Router for this project, with 3 routes. I also used LocalStorage to persist data and used Cypress to test my application with End to End testing.
